  # labels:
  # The set of labels to include when average != 'binary', and their order if average is None. Labels present in the data can be excluded, for example to calculate a multiclass average ignoring a majority negative class, while labels not present in the data will result in 0 components in a macro average. For multilabel targets, labels are column indices. By default, all labels in y_true and y_pred are used in sorted order.
  # array-like, default=None

  sample_weight:
  # Sample weights.
  # array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
